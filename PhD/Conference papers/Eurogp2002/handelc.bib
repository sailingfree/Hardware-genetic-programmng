  abstract       = {The problem of programming an artificial ant to follow
                   the Santa Fe trail is used as an example program search
                   space. genetic programming, simulated annealing and
                   hill climbing performance is shown not to be much
                   better than random search on the Ant problem.
                   Enumeration of a small fraction of the total search
                   space and random sampling characterise it as rugged
                   with multiple plateaus split by deep valleys and many
                   local and global optima. This suggests it is difficult
                   for hill climbing algorithms. Analysis of the program
                   search space in terms of fixed length schema suggests
                   it is highly deceptive and that for the simplest
                   solutions large building blocks must be assembled
                   before they have above average fitness. In some cases
                   we show solutions cannot be assembled using a fixed
                   representation from small building blocks of above
                   average fitness. This suggest the Ant problem is
                   difficult for Genetic Algorithms. Random sampling of
                   the program search space suggests on average the
                   density of global optima changes only slowly with
                   program size but the density of neutral networks
                   linking points of the same fitness grows approximately
                   linearly with program length. This is part of the cause
                   of bloat.},

                   proposed for implementing linearly structured Genetic
                   Programs. Such a context enables consideration of micro
                   architectural and instruction design issues not
                   normally possible when using classical Von Neumann
                   machines. More importantly, the desirability of
                   minimising memory management overheads results in the
                   imposition of additional constraints to the crossover
                   operator. Specifically, individuals are described in
                   terms of the number of pages and page length, where the
                   page length is common across individuals of the
                   population. Pairwise crossover therefore results in the
                   swapping of equal length pages, hence minimising memory
                   overheads. Simulation of the approach demonstrates that
                   the method warrants further study.},

                   solving non-trivial problems with evolutionary
                   algorithms is the task of measuring the fitness of each
                   individual in each generation of the evolving
                   population. The advent of rapidly reconfigurable
                   field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and the idea of
                   evolvable hardware opens the possiblity of embodying
                   each individual of the evolving population into
                   hardware for the purpose of accelerating the
                   time-consuming fitness evaluation task This paper
                   demonstrates how the massive parallelism of the rapidly
                   reconfigurable Xilinx XC6216 FPGA can be exploited to
                   accelerate the computationally burdensome fitness
                   evaluation task of genetic programming. The work was
                   done on Virtual Computing Corporation's low-cost HOTS
                   expansion board for PC type computers. A 16-step
                   7-sorter was evolved that has two fewer steps than the
                   sorting network described in the 1962 O'Connor and
                   Nelson patent on sorting networks and that has the same
                   number of steps as the minimal 7-sorter that was
                   devised by Floyd and Knuth subsequent to the patent.},

                   called Cartesian Genetic Programming in which a program
                   is represented as an indexed graph. The graph is
                   encoded in the form of a linear string of integers. The
                   inputs or terminal set and node outputs are numbered
                   sequentially. The node functions are also separately
                   numbered. The genotype is just a list of node
                   connections and functions. The genotype is then mapped
                   to an indexed graph that can be executed as a program.
                   Evolutionary algorithms are used to evolve the genotype
                   in a symbolic regression problem (sixth order
                   polynomial) and the Santa Fe Ant Trail. The
                   computational effort is calculated for both cases. It
                   is suggested that hit effort is a more reliable measure
                   of computational efficiency. A neutral search strategy
                   that allows the fittest genotype to be replaced by
                   another equally fit genotype (a neutral genotype) is
                   examined and compared with non-neutral search for the
                   Santa Fe ant problem. The neutral search proves to be
                   much more effective.},

                   structures, recursion, protected functions, string and
                   list functions. Any C-function can be compiled and
                   linked into the function set of the system. The use of
                   register machine language allows us to work at the
                   lowest level of binary machine code without any
                   interpreting steps. In a von Neumann machine, programs
                   and data reside in the same memory and the genetic
                   operators can thus directly manipulate the binary
                   machine code in memory. The genetic operators
                   themselves are written in C-language but they modify
                   individuals in binary representation. The result is an
                   execution speed enhancement of up to 100 times compared
                   to an interpreting C-language implementation, and up to
                   2000 times compared to a LISP implementation. The use
                   of binary machine code demands a very compact coding},

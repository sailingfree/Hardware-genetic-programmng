WHAT'S NEW IN LIL-GP 1.0
========================

The improvements:

Checkpoint files.  The checkpoint code, which was broken in 0.99b, has
    been completely rewritten.  Checkpoint files are now text files, so
    you should be able to write programs that read and interpret them
    more easily.

Kernel comments.  All the kernel code now has comments.  There is also
    a chapter in the user manual discussing some of the inner workings.

Bug fixes.

    
0.99b applications require a few mostly trivial changes.  The parameter
file format has not changed.  Checkpoint files produced by prior
versions are unusable.

Be sure to check the configuration section at the top of
kernel/GNUmakefile.kernel for changes.

    
CONVERTING APPLICATIONS FROM 0.99b TO 1.0
=========================================

1. app_initialize() now has a single integer parameter -- a flag
   indicating whether or not the run is starting from a checkpoint.  The
   regression sample problem, for example, uses this to determine if it
   needs to generate fitness cases (if they aren't loaded from the
   checkpoint file).

2. The open filehandle passed to app_write_checkpoint() and
   app_read_checkpoint() is now in text mode.  Adjust your writing and
   reading routines accordingly.  To deal with binary data, you can
   use the functions:

        write_hex_block ( void *p, int n, FILE *f )
        read_hex_block ( void *p, int n, FILE *f )

   to read and write arbitrary blocks of memory.  It is suggested that
   you read and write real values as hex data to avoid loss of
   precision.

3. Read section 6.4 of the manual.  The calling order for some kernel and
   user initialization functions has changed.  Application code
   shouldn't depend on this, but you may have to make changes if
   you're doing something esoteric.

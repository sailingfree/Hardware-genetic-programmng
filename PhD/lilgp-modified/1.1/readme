This is lil-gp 1.0, the first official release version of our genetic
programming system.  Please let us know what you think.  You can send
email to:

        zongker@isl.cps.msu.edu

lil-gp.  An up-to-date WWW page on lil-gp can be found at:

The unpacked distribution should look like this:

     lilgp/
        app/
           ant/                <-- artificial ant problem
           lawnmower/          <-- lawnmower problem (ADFs)
           multiplexer/        <-- boolean 11-multiplexer problem
           regression/         <-- symbolic regression problem
           skeleton/           <-- skeleton code for creating new problems
           twobox/             <-- two-boxes problem (ADFs)
        docs/
        kernel/               
        params/                <-- sample parameter files
        aux/                   <-- miscellany

The documentation is now only available in PostScript format.  There
is also a text file, produced by dvi2tty and fixed up by hand, but the
PostScript is still better.

Information on what's new in this release and on converting
applications from the previous version (0.99b) can be found in the
file "UPGRADE".

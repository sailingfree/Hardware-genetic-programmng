                   genetic programming in the C programming language using
                   a PC type computer (running Windows) acting as a host
                   and a network of processing nodes using the transputer
                   architecture. Using this approach, researchers of
                   genetic algorithms and genetic programming can acquire
                   computing power that is intermediate between the power
                   of currently available workstations and that of
                   supercomputers at a cost that is intermediate between
                   the two. This approach is illustrated by a comparison
                   of the computational effort required to solve the
                   problem of symbolic regression of the Boolean
                   even-5-parity function with different migration rates.
                   Genetic programming required the least computational
                   effort with an 5\% migration rate. Moreover, this
                   computational effort was less than that required for
                   solving the problem with a serial computer and a
                   panmictic population of the same size. That is, apart
                   from the nearly linear speed-up in executing a fixed
                   amount of code inherent in the parallel implementation
                   of genetic programming, the use of distributed
                   sub-populations with only limited migration delivered
                   more than linear speed-up in solving the problem.},

                   FROM THE FOREWORD BY J.R. KOZA Genetic programming
                   addresses the problem of automatic programming, namely
                   the problem of how to enable a computer to do useful
                   things without instructing it, step by step, on how to
                   do it. The rapid growth of the field of genetic
                   programming reflects the growing recognition that,
                   after half a century of research in the fields of
                   artificial intelligence, machine learning, adaptive
                   systems, automated logic, expert systems, and neural
                   networks, we may finally have a way to achieve
                   automatic programming. Genetic programming is
                   fundamentally different from other approaches in terms
                   of (i) its representation (namely, programs), (ii) the
                   role of knowledge (none), (iii) the role of logic
                   (none), and (iv) its mechanism (gleaned from nature)
                   for getting to a solution within the space of possible
                   solutions. FROM THE FIRST SECTION OF THE BOOK Automated
                   programming will be one of the most important areas of
                   computer science research over the next twenty years.
                   Hardware speed and capability has leapt forward
                   exponentially. Yet software consistently lags years
                   behind the capabilities of the hardware. The gap
                   appears to be ever increasing. Demand for computer code
                   keeps growing but the process of writing code is still
                   mired in the modern day equivalent of the medieval
                   ``guild'' days. Like swords in the $15^{\mathrm{th}}$
                   century, muskets before the early 19th century and
                   books before the printing press, each piece of computer
                   code is, today, handmade by a craftsman for a
                   particular purpose. The history of computer programming
                   is a history of attempts to move away from the
                   ``craftsman'' approach -- structured programming,
                   object oriented programming, object libraries, rapid
                   prototyping. But each of these advances leaves the code
                   that does the real work firmly in the hands of a
                   craftsman, the programmer. The ability to enable
                   computers to learn to program themselves is of the
                   utmost importance in freeing the computer industry and
                   the computer user from code that is obsolete before it
                   is released.},

                   There has previously been no general automated
                   technique for automatically creating the design for an
                   analog electrical circuit from a high-level statement
                   of the circuit's desired behavior. We have demonstrated
                   how genetic programming can be used to automate the
                   design of seven prototypical analog circuits, including
                   a lowpass filter, a highpass filter, a passband filter,
                   a bandpass filter, a frequency-measuring circuit, a 60
                   dB amplifier, a differential amplifier, a computational
                   circuit for the square root function, and a
                   time-optimal robot controller circuit. All seven of
                   these genetically evolved circuits constitute instances
                   of an evolutionary computation technique solving a
                   problem that is usually thought to require human
                   intelligence. The approach described herein can be
                   directly applied to many other problems of analog
                   circuit synthesis.},

                   growing branch of evolutionary computation is gradually
                   proving to be a promising method of modelling complex
                   prediction and classification problems. This paper
                   evaluates the suitability of a linear genetic
                   programming (LGP) technique to predict electricity
                   demand in the State of Victoria, Australia, while
                   comparing its performance with two other popular soft
                   computing techniques. The forecast accuracy is compared
                   with the actual energy demand. To evaluate, we
                   considered load demand patterns for ten consecutive
                   months taken every 30 minutes for training the
                   different prediction models. Test results show that
                   while the linear genetic programming method delivered
                   satisfactory results, the neuro fuzzy system performed
                   best for this particular application problem, in terms

                   optimization method based on the model of natural
                   evolution. One important operator in these algorithms
                   is the selection scheme for which a new description
                   model is introduced in this paper. With this a
                   mathematical analysis of tournament selection,
                   truncation selection, linear and exponential ranking
                   selection and proportional selection is carried out
                   that allows an exact prediction of the fitness values
                   after selection. The further analysis derives the
                   selection intensity, selection variance, and the loss
                   of diversity for all selection schemes. For completion
                   a pseudo- code formulation of each method is included.
                   The selection schemes are compared and evaluated
                   according to their properties leading to an unified
                   view of these different selection schemes. Furthermore
                   the correspondence of binary tournament selection and
                   ranking selection in the expected fitness distribution

                   convergence problem and the redundancy in the trees in
                   GP. It turned out that "bloating" is a property of GP
                   that arises from the fact that more redundant trees
                   have a higher probability to survive crossover. As a
                   result, the redundant part of the trees grow bigger and
                   bigger because the increased proportion of redundant
                   "cut-sites" in the tree again lead to a higher
                   probability to survive crossover. Gives a formula for
                   tournament size related to proportion of crossover in a

  abstract       = {With the continuing exponential growth of the Internet
                   and the more recent growth of business Intranets, the
                   commercial world is becoming increasingly aware of the
                   problem of electronic information overload. This has
                   encouraged interest in developing agents/softbots that
                   can act as electronic personal assistants and can
                   develop and adapt representations of users information
                   needs, commonly known as profiles. As the result of
                   collaborative research with Friends of the Earth, an
                   environmental issues campaigning organisation, we have
                   developed a general purpose information classification
                   agent architecture and have applied it to the problem
                   of document classification and routing. Collaboration
                   with Friends of the Earth allows us to test our ideas
                   in a non-academic context involving high volumes of
                   documents. We use the technique of genetic programming
                   (GP), (Koza and Rice 1992), to evolve classifying
                   agents. This is a novel approach for document
                   classification, where each agent evolves a parse-tree
                   representation of a user's particular information need.
                   The other unusual features of our research are the
                   longevity of our agents and the fact that they undergo
                   a continual training process; feedback from the user
                   enables the agent to adapt to the user's long-term
                   information requirements.},

                   basis for a wide range of learning algorithms. However,
                   the technique has to date only been successfully
                   applied to modest tasks because of the performance
                   overheads of evolving a large number of data
                   structures, many of which do not correspond to a valid
                   program. We address this problem directly and
                   demonstrate how the evolutionary process can be
                   achieved with much greater efficiency through the use
                   of a formally-based representation and strong typing.
                   We report initial experimental results which
                   demonstrate that our technique exhibits significantly
                   better performance than previous work.},

                   genetic optimization and simulation methodology, to
                   evaluate a multi-objective fitness function which
                   includes both the suitability of the filter transfer
                   function and the transition activity of digital blocks.
                   The proper choice of fitness function and selection
                   criteria allows the genetic algorithm to perform a
                   better search within the design space, thus exploring
                   possible solutions which are not considered in the
                   conventional structured design methodology. Although
                   the evolutionary process is not guaranteed to generate
                   a filter fully compliant to specifications in every
                   run, experimental evidence shows that, when
                   specifications are met, evolved filters are much better

  abstract       = {The parallel execution of several populations in
                   evolutionary algorithms has usually given good results.
                   Nevertheless, researchers have to date drawn
                   conflicting conclusions when using some of the parallel
                   genetic programming models. One aspect of the conflict
                   is population size, since published GP works do not
                   agree about whether to use large or small populations.
                   This paper presents an experimental study of a number
                   of common GP test problems. Via our experiments, we
                   discovered that an optimal range of values exists. This
                   assists us in our choice of population size and in the
                   selection of an appropriate parallel genetic
                   programming model. Finding efficient parameters helps
                   us to speed up our search for solutions. At the same
                   time, it allows us to locate features that are common
                   to parallel genetic programming and the classic genetic
                   programming technique.},

                   analytical instruments, is a novel tool for the
                   investigation of complex biological systems at the
                   whole-tissue level. In this study, samples from tomato
                   fruit grown hydroponically under both high- and
                   low-salt conditions were analysed using
                   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), with
                   the aim of identifying spectral and biochemical
                   features linked to salinity in the growth environment.
                   FTIR spectra are not amenable to direct visual
                   analysis, so supervised machine learning was used to
                   generate models capable of classifying the samples
                   based on their spectral characteristics. The genetic
                   programming (GP) method was chosen, since it has
                   previously been shown to perform with the same accuracy
                   as conventional data modelling methods, but in a
                   readily-interpretable form. Examination of the
                   GP-derived models showed that there was a small number
                   of spectral regions that were consistently being used.
                   In particular, the spectral region containing
                   absorbances potentially due to a cyanide/nitrile
                   functional group was identified as discriminatory. The
                   explanatory power of the GP models enabled a chemical
                   interpretation of the biochemical differences to be
                   proposed. The combination of FTIR and GP is therefore a
                   powerful and novel analytical tool which, in this
                   study, improves our understanding of the biochemistry
                   of salt tolerance in tomato plants.},

                   analysed by Curie-point pyrolysis mass spectrometry

                   surprisingly, that the discrimination between coffee,
                   tea and cola was very easy. However, cluster analysis
                   also indicated that there was a secondary difference
                   between these beverages which could be attributed to
                   whether they were caffeine- containing or
                   decaffeinated. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) could
                   be trained, with the pyrolysis mass spectra from some
                   of the freeze dried coffees, to classify correctly the
                   caffeine status of the unseen spectra of freeze dried
                   coffee, filter coffee, tea and cola in an independent
                   test set. However, the information in terms of which
                   masses in the mass spectrum are important was not
                   available, which is why ANNs are often perceived as a
                   'black box' approach to modelling spectra. By contrast,
                   genetic programs (GPs) could also be used to classify
                   correctly the caffeine status of the beverages, but
                   which evolved function trees (or mathematical rules)
                   enabling the deconvolution of the spectra and which
                   highlighted that m/z 67, 109 and 165 were the most
                   significant massed for this classification. Moreover,
                   the chemical structure of these mass ions could be
                   assigned to the reproducible pyrolytic degradation
                   products from caffeine.},

                   Programming to visibility space calculation, for Sensor
                   Planning in Machine Vision. This is a problem
                   considerably more complex than most for which GP has
                   been used; no closed-form algorithm for it yet exists
                   in the most general case. The main contributions and
                   results are the application of GP to a new field, and
                   the conclusion that GP is better suited to solve this
                   complex problem by a generate-and-test approach than an
                   analytic one. Three systems were implemented to evolve
                   programs for calculating visibility spaces. The first
                   used untyped GP and low-level operations, for maximum
                   flexibility in evolution, but could solve the problem
                   only for trivial cases. The second used high-level
                   geometric operations and typed GP, but tended to get
                   trapped in local optima. Approaches used,
                   unsuccessfully, to obviate this included altering the
                   fitness cases and function set both statically and
                   dynamically, parameter tuning, seeding the population,
                   using program templates, and using a simpler system for
                   modelling evolution. The third system, which used a
                   generate-and-test approach, evolved useful solutions.
                   When seeded with hand-crafted partial solutions, it was
                   able to improve them considerably. The work shows the
                   potential of GP to evolve or refine a region-growing
                   generate-and-test algorithm for calculating visibility
                   spaces, a problem not hitherto approached by the GP
                   community.},

                   generating computer programs, which are stored as data
                   structures and manipulated to evolve better programs.
                   An extension restricting the search space is Strongly
                   Typed Genetic Programming (STGP), which has, as a basic
                   premise, the removal of closure by typing both the
                   arguments and return values of functions, and by also
                   typing the terminal set. A restriction of STGP is that
                   there are only two levels of typing. We extend STGP by
                   allowing a type hierarchy, which allows more than two
                   levels of typing.},

                   of the state-space which must be searched for large and
                   complex problem domains. One method to reduce the
                   state-space size is by using Strongly Typed Genetic
                   Programming (STGP). We applied both GP and STGP to
                   construct cooperation strategies to be used by multiple
                   predator agents to pursue and capture a prey agent on a
                   grid-world. This domain has been extensively studied in
                   Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) as an
                   easy-to-describe but difficult-to-solve cooperation
                   problem. The evolved programs from our systems are
                   competitive with manually derived greedy algorithms. In
                   particular the STGP paradigm evolved strategies in
                   which the predators were able to achieve their goal
                   without explicitly sensing the location of other
                   predators or communicating with other predators. This
                   represents an improvement over previous research in
                   this area. The results of our experiments indicate that
                   STGP is able to evolve programs that perform
                   significantly better than GP evolved programs. In
                   addition, the programs generated by STGP were easier to
                   understand.},

                   multiplexer as the only design unit. Any logic function
                   (defined by a truth table) can be produced through the

                   works in two stages: first, it finds feasible
                   solutions, and then it concentrates on the minimization
                   of the circuit. The proposed approach does not require

                   Programs. Such a context enables consideration of micro
                   architectural and instruction design issues not
                   normally possible when using classical Von Neumann
                   machines. More importantly, the desirability of
                   minimising memory management overheads results in the
                   imposition of additional constraints to the crossover
                   operator. Specifically, individuals are described in
                   terms of the number of pages and page length, where the
                   page length is common across individuals of the
                   population. Pairwise crossover therefore results in the
                   swapping of equal length pages, hence minimising memory
                   overheads. Simulation of the approach demonstrates that
                   the method warrants further study.},

                   its breadth of application increases, the need for
                   parallel implementations becomes absolutely necessary.
                   The transputer-based system presented in [Koza95] is
                   one of the rare such parallel implementations. Until
                   today, no implementation has been proposed for parallel
                   GP using a SIMD architecture, except for a
                   data-parallel approach [tufts95], although others have
                   exploited workstation farms and pipelined
                   supercomputers. One reason is certainly the apparent
                   difficulty of dealing with the parallel evaluation of
                   different S-expressions when only a single instruction
                   can be executed at the same time on every processor.
                   The aim of this chapter is to present such an
                   implementation of parallel GP on a SIMD system, where
                   each processor can efficiently evaluate a different
                   S-expression. We have implemented this approach on a
                   MasPar MP-2 computer, and will present some timing
                   results. To the extent that SIMD machines, like the
                   MasPar are available to offer cost-effective cycles for
                   scientific experimentation, this is a useful approach.},

                   inherently hierarchical. The paper describes computer
                   experiments, using the author's 4341 line LISP program,
                   in five areas of artificial intelligence, namely (1)
                   sequence induction (e.g. inducing a computational
                   procedure for the recursive Fibonacci sequence and
                   inducing a computational procedure for a cubic
                   polynomial sequence), (2) automatic programming (e.g.
                   discovering a computational procedure for solving pairs
                   of linear equations, solving quadratic equations for
                   complex roots, and discovering trigonometric
                   identities), (3) machine learning of functions (e.g.
                   learning a Boolean multiplexer function previously
                   studied in neural net and classifier system work and
                   learning the exclusive-or and parity function), (4)
                   planning (e.g. developing a robotic action sequence
                   that can stack an arbitrary initial configuration of
                   blocks into a specified order), and (5) pattern
                   recognition (e.g. translation-invariant recognition of
                   a simple one dimensional shape in a linear retina).},

  abstract       = {Many seemingly different problems in artificial
                   intelligence, symbolic processing, and machine learning
                   can be viewed as requiring discovery of a computer
                   program that produces some desired output for
                   particular inputs. When viewed in this way, the process
                   of solving these problems becomes equivalent to
                   searching a space of possible computer programs for a
                   most fit individual computer program. The new "genetic
                   programming" paradigm described herein provides a way
                   to search for this most fit individual computer
                   program. In this new "genetic programming" paradigm,
                   populations of computer programs are genetically bred
                   using the Darwinian principle of survival of the
                   fittest and using a genetic crossover (recombination)
                   operator appropriate for genetically mating computer
                   programs. In this paper, the process of formulating and
                   solving problems using this new paradigm is illustrated
                   using examples from various areas. Examples come from
                   the areas of machine learning of a function; planning;
                   sequence induction; function function identification
                   (including symbolic regression, empirical discovery,
                   "data to function" symbolic integration, "data to
                   function" symbolic differentiation); solving equations,
                   including differential equations, integral equations,
                   and functional equations); concept formation; automatic
                   programming; pattern recognition, time-optimal control;
                   playing differential pursuer-evader games; neural
                   network design; and finding a game-playing strategyfor

                   world's ever-growing archive of protein sequences, they
                   are typically immediately tested by various algorithms
                   for clues as to their biological structure and
                   function. One question about a new protein involves its
                   cellular location \&shyp; that is, where the protein
                   resides in a living organism (extracellular, membrane,
                   etc.). A human-created five-way algorithm for cellular
                   location using statistical techniques with 76\%
                   accuracy was recently reported. This paper describes a
                   two-way algorithm that was evolved using genetic
                   programming with 83\% accuracy for determining whether
                   a protein is extracellular and with 89\% accuracy for
                   membrane proteins. Unlike the statistical calculation,
                   the genetically evolved algorithm employs a large and
                   varied arsenal of computational capabilities, including
                   arithmetic functions, conditional operations,
                   subroutines, iterations, memory, data structures,
                   set-creating operations, macro definitions, recursion,
                   etc. The genetically evolved classification algorithm
                   can be viewed as an extension (which we call a
                   programmatic motif) of the conventional notion of a
                   protein motif.},

                   and developmental biology. The design process starts
                   with the random creation of a large population of
                   program trees composed of circuit-constructing
                   functions. Each program tree specifies the steps by
                   which a fully developed circuit is to be progressively
                   developed from a common embryonic circuit appropriate
                   for the type of circuit that the user wishes to design.
                   Each fully developed circuit is translated into a
                   netlist, simulated using a modified version of SPICE,
                   and evaluated as to how well it satisfies the user's
                   design requirements. The fitness measure is a
                   user-written computer program that may incorporate any
                   calculable characteristic or combination of
                   characteristics of the circuit, including the circuit's
                   behavior in the time domain, its behavior in the
                   frequency domain, its power consumption, the number of
                   components, cost of components, or surface area

                   trees is genetically bred over a series of many
                   generations using genetic programming. Genetic
                   programming is driven by a fitness measure and employs
                   genetic operations such as Darwinian reproduction,
                   sexual recombination (crossover), and occasional
                   mutation to create offspring. This automated
                   evolutionary process produces both the topology of the
                   circuit and the numerical values for each component.
                   This paper describes how genetic programming can evolve

                   There has previously been no general automated
                   technique for automatically designing an analog
                   electrical circuit from a high-level statement of the
                   circuit's desired behavior. This chapter introduces
                   genetic programming and shows how it can be used to
                   automate the design of both the topology and sizing of
                   a suite of five prototypical analog circuits, including
                   a lowpass filter, a tri-state frequency discriminator
                   circuit, a 60 dB amplifier, a computational circuit for
                   the square root, and a time-optimal robot controller
                   circuit. The problem-specific information required for
                   each of the eight problems is minimal and consists
                   primarily of the number of inputs and outputs of the
                   desired circuit, the types of available components, and
                   a fitness measure that restates the high-level
                   statement of the circuit's desired behavior as a
                   measurable mathematical quantity. All five of these

  abstract       = {Analog electrical circuits that perform mathematical
                   functions (e.g., cube root, square) are called
                   computational circuits. Computational circuits are of
                   special practical importance when the small number of
                   required mathematical functions does not warrant
                   converting an analog signal into a digital signal,
                   performing the mathematical function in the digital
                   domain, and then converting the result back to the
                   analog domain. The design of computational circuits is
                   difficult even for mundane mathematical functions and
                   often relies on the clever exploitation of some aspect
                   of the underlying device physics of the components.
                   Moreover, implementation of each different mathematical
                   function typically requires an entirely different
                   clever insight. This paper demonstrates that
                   computational circuits can be designed without such
                   problem-specific insights using a single uniform
                   approach involving genetic programming. Both the
                   circuit topology and the sizing of all circuit
                   components are created by genetic programming. This
                   uniform approach to the automated synthesis of
                   computational circuits is illustrated by evolving
                   circuits that perform the cube root function (for which
                   no circuit was found in the published literature) as
                   well as for the square root, square, and cube
                   functions.},

                   designs that satisfy prespecified high-level design
                   requirements for analog electrical circuits and other
                   complex structures. However, in the real world, it is
                   often important that a design satisfy various
                   non-technical requirements. One such requirement is
                   that a design not possess the key characteristics of
                   any previously known design. This paper shows that
                   genetic programming can be used to generate novel
                   solutions to a design problem so that genetic
                   programming may be potentially used as an invention
                   machine. This paper turns the clock back to the period
                   just before the time (1917) when George Campbell of
                   American Telephone and Telegraph invented and patented
                   the design for an electrical circuit that is now known
                   as the ladder filter. Genetic programming is used to
                   reinvent the Campbell filter. The paper then turns the
                   clock back to the period just before the time (1928)
                   when Wilhelm Cauer invented and patented the elliptic
                   filter. Genetic programming is then used to reinvent a
                   technically equivalent filter that avoids the key
                   characteristics of then-preexisting Campbell filter.
                   Genetic programming can be used as an invention machine
                   by employing a two-part fitness measure that
                   incorporates both the degree to which an individual in
                   the population satisfies the given technical
                   requirements and the degree to which the individual
                   does not possess the key characteristics of preexisting
                   technology.},

                   variables is "general" in the sense that it provides a
                   solution to an entire category of problems. For
                   example, the familiar formula for solving a quadratic
                   equation contains free variables representing the
                   equation's coefficients. Previous work has demonstrated
                   that genetic programming can automatically synthesize
                   the design for a controller consisting of a topological
                   arrangement of signal processing blocks (such as

                   user-specified requirements. The question arises as to
                   whether it is possible to use genetic programming to

                   entire category of such controller design problems

                   shows, for an illustrative problem, how genetic
                   programming can be used to create the design for both
                   the topology and tuning of controller, where the

                   complexity'') during artificial evolution. We show
                   bloat is not specific to genetic programming and
                   suggest it is inherent in search techniques with
                   discrete variable length representations using simple
                   static evaluation functions. We investigate the
                   bloating characteristics of three non-population and
                   one population based search techniques using a novel
                   mutation operator. An artificial ant following the
                   Santa Fe trail problem is solved by simulated
                   annealing, hill climbing, strict hill climbing and
                   population based search using two variants of the the
                   new subtree based mutation operator. As predicted bloat
                   is observed when using unbiased mutation and is absent
                   in simulated annealing and both hill climbers when
                   using the length neutral mutation however bloat occurs
                   with both mutations when using a population. We
                   conclude that there are two causes of bloat. },

                   The results presented herein show, in some cases,
                   provision of appropriately structured memory can indeed
                   be advantageous to GP in comparison with directly
                   addressable indexed memory. Three ``classic'' problems
                   are solved. The first two require the GP to distinguish
                   between sentences that are in a language and those that
                   are not given positive and negative training examples
                   of the language. The two languages are, correctly
                   nested brackets and a Dyck language (correctly nested
                   brackets of different types). The third problem is to
                   evaluate integer Reverse Polish (postfix) expressions.

  notes          = "Computers that {"}program themselves{"} has long been
                   an aim of computer scientists. Recently genetic
                   programming (GP) has started to show its promise by
                   automatically evolving programs. Indeed in a small
                   number of problems GP has evolved programs whose
                   performance is similar to or even slightly better than
                   that of programs written by people. The main thrust of
                   GP has been to automatically create functions. While
                   these can be of great use they contain no memory and
                   relatively little work has addressed automatic creation
                   of program code including stored data. It is this issue
                   which GENETIC PROGRAMMING AND DATA STRUCTURES
                   addresses. Motivated by the observation from software
                   engineering that data abstraction (e.g., via abstract
                   data types) is essential in programs created by human
                   programmers. This book will show that abstract data
                   types can be similarly beneficial to the automatic
                   production of programs using GP. GENETIC PROGRAMMING
                   AND DATA STRUCTURES shows how abstract data types
                   (stacks, queues and lists) can be evolved using genetic
                   programming, demonstrate GP can evolve general programs
                   which solve the nested brackets problem, recognise a
                   Dyck context free language and implement a simple four
                   function calculator. In these cases an appropriate data
                   structure is beneficial compared to simple indexed
                   memory. This book also includes a survey of GP,
                   including a critical review of experiments with
                   evolving memory and reports investigations of real
                   world electrical network maintenance scheduling
                   problems that demonstrate that Genetic Algorithms can
                   find low cost viable solutions to such problems.
                   GENETIC PROGRAMMING AND DATA STRUCTURES should be of
                   direct interest to computer scientists doing research
                   on genetic programming, genetic algorithms, data
                   structures, and artificial intelligence. In addition,
                   this book will be of interest to practitioners working
                   in all of these areas and to those interested in
                   automatic programming. Contents Foreword by John R.

                   the Santa Fe trail is used as an example program search
                   space. genetic programming, simulated annealing and
                   hill climbing performance is shown not to be much
                   better than random search on the Ant problem.
                   Enumeration of a small fraction of the total search
                   space and random sampling characterise it as rugged
                   with multiple plateaus split by deep valleys and many
                   local and global optima. This suggests it is difficult
                   for hill climbing algorithms. Analysis of the program
                   search space in terms of fixed length schema suggests
                   it is highly deceptive and that for the simplest
                   solutions large building blocks must be assembled
                   before they have above average fitness. In some cases
                   we show solutions cannot be assembled using a fixed
                   representation from small building blocks of above
                   average fitness. This suggest the Ant problem is
                   difficult for Genetic Algorithms. Random sampling of
                   the program search space suggests on average the
                   density of global optima changes only slowly with
                   program size but the density of neutral networks
                   linking points of the same fitness grows approximately

                   grow rapidly and relatively independent of fitness, a
                   serious flaw which has received considerable attention
                   in the genetic programming literature. Much of this
                   literature has implicated introns, subtree structures
                   with no effect on the an individual's fitness
                   assessment. The propagation of inviable code, a certain
                   kind of intron, has been especially linked to tree
                   growth. However this paper presents evidence which
                   shows that denying inviable code the opportunity to
                   propagate actually increases tree growth. The paper
                   argues that rather than causing tree growth, a rise in
                   inviable code is in fact an expected result of tree
                   growth. Lastly, this paper proposes a more general
                   theory of growth for which introns are merely a
                   symptom.},

                   crossover, and combinations of mutation and crossover
                   in genetic programming (GP). The literature of
                   traditional genetic algorithms contains related
                   studies, but mutation and crossover in GP differ from
                   their traditional counterparts in significant ways. In
                   this paper we present the results from a very large
                   experimental data set, the equivalent of approximately
                   12,000 typical runs of a GP system, systematically
                   exploring a range of parameter settings. The resulting
                   data may be useful not only for practitioners seeking
                   to optimize parameters for GP runs, but also for
                   theorists exploring issues such as the role of
                   "building blocks" in GP.},

                   parameter settings. Unfortunately, the results were
                   marred by statistical flaws. This revision of the study
                   eliminates these flaws, with three times as much the
                   data as the original experiments had. Our results again
                   show that crossover does have some advantage over
                   mutation given the right parameter settings (primarily
                   larger population sizes), though the difference between
                   the two surprisingly small. Further, the results are

                   offer services to customers. The creation of these
                   services has traditionally been performed by hand, and
                   has required substantial effort, despite the advanced
                   tools employed. An alternative to manual service
                   creation using Genetic Programming is proposed that
                   addresses some of the limitations of the manual process
                   of service creation. The main benefit of using GP is
                   that by focussing on what a service is required to do,
                   as opposed to its implementation, it is more likely
                   that the generated programs will be available on time
                   and to budget, when compared to traditional software
                   engineering techniques. The problem of closure is
                   tackled by presenting a new technique for ensuring
                   correct program syntax that maintains genetic

                   state of execution, this model allows the removal of
                   execution time and iteration limits. Populations can
                   then tolerate individuals with infinite loops (or in a
                   suitable environment, infinite recursion), while still

                   09:36:34 -0700 From: "Sidney R Maxwell III" > 1-How did
                   Maxwell implement his method? Basically, I executed
                   each individual a fixed number of steps (a
                   'configurable' number N, with a value of as little
                   as1). Individuals added to the population were
                   pre-executed an appropraite number of steps to ensure
                   that all individuals in the population had executed the
                   same number of steps. The problem that I was tackling
                   was the Artificial Ant, for which evaluating fitness on
                   partially executed individuals was meaningful. In early
                   experiments, I executed all individuals in the
                   population N steps. Later, as a run-time performance
                   enhancement, I [simply] ensured that individuals being
                   evaluated had executed the same number of steps before
                   comparing their fitness.},

                   called Cartesian Genetic Programming in which a program
                   is represented as an indexed graph. The graph is
                   encoded in the form of a linear string of integers. The
                   inputs or terminal set and node outputs are numbered
                   sequentially. The node functions are also separately
                   numbered. The genotype is just a list of node
                   connections and functions. The genotype is then mapped
                   to an indexed graph that can be executed as a program.
                   Evolutionary algorithms are used to evolve the genotype
                   in a symbolic regression problem (sixth order
                   polynomial) and the Santa Fe Ant Trail. The
                   computational effort is calculated for both cases. It
                   is suggested that hit effort is a more reliable measure
                   of computational efficiency. A neutral search strategy
                   that allows the fittest genotype to be replaced by
                   another equally fit genotype (a neutral genotype) is
                   examined and compared with non-neutral search for the
                   Santa Fe ant problem. The neutral search proves to be
                   much more effective.},

                   surprising differences from and surprising similarities
                   with modern Forth systems. The system they describe
                   uses text interpretation instead of threaded code for
                   definitions, although there is already a code field,
                   i.e., the foundation for indirect threading. During the
                   interpretation of a definition, only words defined
                   earlier are visible, like in modern Forths, and in
                   contrast to Postscript. To make text interpretation
                   speed bearable, the dictionary is implemented as a hash
                   table with external chaining. There is support for
                   portably generating CODE words (called verbs in the
                   paper). The syntax is a bit more complicated than
                   today: special characters may only come as first
                   character in a word, so words are not only separated by
                   spaces. The system already features multitasking
                   (round-robin, with preemption). Source is stored in
                   screens (then called sheets) containing 50 lines by 40
                   characters. The programs look markedly different than
                   today because the primary stack manipulation words are
                   @T (similar to PICK) and =T (similar to a word
                   sometimes called STICK). Forth was running on the
                   IBM~1130 and the Burroughs B-5500 (different cell
                   sizes). The paper also observes that compactness of
                   programs ``arises through the economies of tailoring
                   definitions to a specific application'', and is more
                   pronounced in larger programs.",

                   register machines of von Neumann type. We have
                   developed a method to evolve Turing-complete programs
                   for a register machine. The described implementation
                   enables the use of most program constructs, such as
                   arithmetic operators, large indexed memory, automatic
                   decomposition into subfunctions and subroutines (ADFs),
                   conditional constructs i.e. if-then-else, jumps, loop
                   structures, recursion, protected functions, string and
                   list functions. Any C-function can be compiled and
                   linked into the function set of the system. The use of
                   register machine language allows us to work at the
                   lowest level of binary machine code without any
                   interpreting steps. In a von Neumann machine, programs
                   and data reside in the same memory and the genetic
                   operators can thus directly manipulate the binary
                   machine code in memory. The genetic operators
                   themselves are written in C-language but they modify
                   individuals in binary representation. The result is an
                   execution speed enhancement of up to 100 times compared
                   to an interpreting C-language implementation, and up to
                   2000 times compared to a LISP implementation. The use
                   of binary machine code demands a very compact coding},

                   Prolog programs. This talk examines GLP applied to
                   Natural Language Understanding to illustrate the power,
                   issues and limitations of GLP. Populations of Prolog
                   query interpreters evolve to respond more correctly to
                   queries about the Aesop fable: "The Fox and the Crow".
                   The interpreters process parsed text and consult a
                   general knowledge-base. The gene pool consists of a
                   large set of Prolog rules and facts which are
                   tentatively proposed as being 'useful' for
                   interpretation. Essentially, interpreters act as an
                   interface between queries, knowledge bases and the
                   text. Closure and termination are addressed at the
                   level of design of the gene pool, and various Prolog
                   options. Fitness amounts to a score on a high school
                   like "comprehension test", with special care to deal
                   with redundant and dependent answers, and with an eye
                   to rewarding correct higher-level abstractions.},

                   binary strings or programs with arity-1 primitives

                   This allows us to characterise the bias induced by

                   optical lens in order to control focalplane irradiance
                   of some laser beam. The numerical simulations of
                   irradiance of the beam through the lens, including some
                   technological constraints on the correlation radius of
                   the phase of the lens, involves two FFT (fast Fourier
                   transforms) computations, whose computational cost
                   heavily depends upon the chosen discretization. A
                   straightforward representation of a solution is that of
                   a matrix of thicknesses, based on a N by N (with N a
                   power of two) discretization of the lens. However, even
                   though some technical simplifications allow us to
                   reduce the size of the search space, its complexity
                   increased quadratically with N, making physically
                   realistic cases (e.g. N >= 256) almost untractable
                   (more than 2000 variables). An alternative
                   representation is brought by GP parse trees, searching
                   in functional space: the genotype does not depend
                   anymore on the chosen discretization. The
                   implementation of both parametric representation (using
                   ES algorithms) and functional approach (using standard
                   GP) for the lens design are described. Both achieve
                   good results compared to the sate-of-the-art methods
                   for small to medium values of the discretization
                   parameter N (up to 256). Moreover, preliminary
                   comparative results are presented between the two
                   representations, and some counter-intuitive results are
                   discussed.},

                   vehicle can be constructed by artificial evolution.
                   Corridor following serves here as an example of a
                   behavior to be obtained through evolution. A
                   controller's fitness is judged by its ability to steer
                   its vehicle along a collision free path through a
                   simple corridor environment. The controller's inputs
                   are noisy range sensors and its output is a noisy
                   steering mechanism. Evolution determines the quantity
                   and placement of sensors. Noise in fitness tests
                   discourages brittle strategies and leads to the
                   evolution of robust, noise-tolerant controllers.
                   Genetic Programming is used to model evolution, the
                   controllers are represented as deterministic computer

                   interaction with the external environment or by
                   analyzing the internal problem-solving traces. Genetic
                   Programming (GP) has been effective in learning via

                   its own search traces. This paper demonstrates how an

                   search to discover useful genetic material and to use
                   it in order to accelerate the search process. The key
                   idea is that of genetic material discovery which
                   enables a restructuring of the search space so that

                   modeling, addressing the problem of identification of a
                   mechanical model for a material. Two kinds of models
                   are considered. One-dimensional dynamic models are
                   represented via symbolic formulations termed em
                   rheological models, which are directly evolved by GP.
                   Three-dimensional static models of hyperelastic
                   materials are expressed in terms of strain energy
                   functions. A model is rated based on the distance
                   between the behavior predicted by the model, and the
                   actual behavior of the material given by a set of
                   mechanical experiments. The choice of GP is motivated
                   by strong arguments, relying on the tree-structure of
                   rheological models in the first case, and on the need
                   for first and second order derivatives in the second
                   case. Key issues are the exploration of viable
                   individuals only, and the use of Gaussian mutations to
                   optimize numerical constants.},

                   This is accomplished by defining a set of node

                   operations commonly used in a large class of DSP

                   optimising the numerical parameters of expression

                   superior to absolute fitness functions [Angeline and
                   Pollack 1993], [Hillis 1992]. This chapter describes a
                   method by which competition can be implemented when
                   training over a fixed (static) set of examples. Since
                   new training cases cannot be generated by mutation or
                   crossover, the probabilistic frequencies by which
                   individual training cases are selected competitively
                   adapt. We evolve decision trees for the problem of word
                   sense disambiguation. The decision trees contain
                   embedded bit strings; bit string crossover is
                   intermingled with subtree-swapping. To approach the
                   problem of overlearning, we have implemented a fitness
                   penalty function specialized for decision trees which
                   is dependent on the partition of the set of training
                   cases implied by a decision tree.},

                   evolved programs to be executed for longer amounts of
                   time. For these applications it is likely that some
                   test cases optimally require more computation cycles
                   than others. Therefore, programs must dynamically
                   allocate cycles among test cases in order to use
                   computation time efficiently. To elicit the strategic
                   allocation of computation time, we impose an it
                   aggregate computation time ceiling that applies over a
                   series of fitness cases. This exerts time pressure on
                   evolved programs, with the effect that resulting
                   programs dynamically allocate computation time,
                   opportunistically spending less time per test case when
                   possible, with minimal damage to domain performance.
                   This technique is in principle extensible to resources
                   other than computation time such as memory or fuel. We
                   introduce the game Tetris as a test problem for this

                   application of evolutionary approaches to the automatic
                   design of automata in general, and Turing machines, in
                   particular. Here, each automaton is represented
                   directly by its state transition table and the number
                   of states is allowed to change dynamically as evolution
                   takes place. This approach contrasts with less natural
                   representation methods such as trees of genetic
                   programming, and allows for easier visualization and
                   hardware implementation of the obtained automata. Two
                   methods are proposed, namely, a straightforward,
                   genetic-algorithm-like one, and a more sophisticated
                   approach involving several operators and the 1/5 rule
                   of evolution strategy. Experiments were carried out for
                   the automatic generation of Turing machines from
                   examples of input and output tapes for problems of
                   sorting, unary arithmetic, and language acceptance, and
                   the results indicate the feasibility of the
                   evolutionary approach. Since Turing machines can be
                   viewed as general representations of computer programs,
                   the proposed approach can be thought of as a step
                   towards the generation of programs and algorithms by
                   evolution.},

                   There are many problems that traditional Genetic
                   Programming (GP) cannot solve, due to the theoretical
                   limitations of its paradigm. A Turing machine (TM) is a

                   Turing complete is sufficiently powerful to recognize
                   all possible algorithms. GP is not Turing complete.

                   are simple mappings from the inputs to the correct
                   outputs; some kind of internal state or memory is
                   needed to operate well or optimally in these domains.
                   Traditionally, genetic programming has concentrated on
                   solving problems in the functional/reactive arena. This
                   may be due in part to the absence of a natural way to
                   incorporate memory into the paradigm. This chapter
                   proposes a simple, Turing-complete addition to the
                   genetic programming paradigm that seamlessly
                   incorporates the evolution of the effective gathering,
                   storage, and retrieval of arbitrarily complicated state
                   information. A new environment is presented and used to
                   evaluate this addition to the paradigm. Experimental
                   results show that the effective production and use of
                   complex memory structures can be evolved and that
                   functions evolving the intelligent use of state quickly
                   and permanently displace purely reactive and
                   non-deterministic functions. These results may aid
                   future research into the causes and constituents of
                   mental models and are shown to open the field of
                   genetic programming to include all learning strategies
                   that are Turing-possible.},

                   mathematical representation of a surface which is given
                   only by a set of discrete sampling points. The
                   mathematical description in the computer allows to save
                   or transfer the geometric data via internet, to
                   manipulate (e.g. for aerodynamic or design specific
                   reasons) or to optimize the machining of the work
                   pieces. The reconstruction of the shape of an object is
                   a difficult mathematical and computer scientific
                   problem. For this reason a GP/ES-hybrid algorithm has
                   been used. Due to the high complexity of the problem
                   and in order to speed up the reconstruction process,
                   the algorithm has been enhanced to work as a
                   multipopulation GP/ES that runs in parallel on a
                   network of standard PCs.},

                   genetic programming(GP) as a tool for real-valued
                   function approximations. Standard GP suffers from the
                   lack of estimation techniques for numerical parameters
                   of a functional tree. Unlike other research activities,
                   where non-linear optimization techniques are employed,
                   we adopt the use of a linear associative memory for the
                   estimation of these parameters under the GP algorithm.
                   Instead of dealing with a large associative matrix, we
                   present the method of building several associative
                   matrixes in small size, each of which is responsible
                   for determining the value for different small portions
                   of the whole parameter. This approach can significantly
                   reduce computational cost, and a reasonably accurate
                   value for parameters can be obtained. Due to the fact
                   that the GP algorithm is likely to fall into a local
                   minimum, the GP algorithm often fails to generate the
                   functional tree with the desired accuracy. This
                   motivates us to devise a group of additive genetic
                   programming trees(GAGPT) which consists of a primary
                   tree and a set of auxiliary trees. The output of the
                   GAGPT is the summation of outputs of the primary tree
                   and all auxiliary trees. The addition of auxiliary
                   trees makes it possible to improve both the learning
                   and generalization capability of the GAGPT, since the
                   auxiliary tree evolves toward refining the quality of
                   the GAGPT by optimizing its fitness function. The
                   effectiveness of our approach is verified by applying
                   the GAGPT to the estimation of the principal dimensions
                   of a bulk cargo ship and engine torque of a passenger
                   car.},

  abstract       = {Genetic Programming (GP) automatically generates
                   computer programs to solve specified problems. It
                   develops programs through the process of a
                   "create-test-modify" cycle which is similar to the way
                   a human writes programs. There are various functional
                   programming techniques that human programmers can use
                   to accelerate the program development process. This
                   research investigated the applicability of some of the
                   functional techniques to GP and analyzed their impact
                   on GP performance. Among many important functional
                   techniques, three were chosen to be included in this
                   research, due to their relevance to GP. They are
                   polymorphism, implicit recursion and higher-order
                   functions. To demonstrate their applicability, a GP
                   system was developed with those techniques
                   incorporated. Furthermore, a number of experiments were
                   conducted using the system. The results were then
                   compared to those generated by other GP systems which
                   do not support these functional features. Finally, the
                   program search space of the general even-parity problem
                   was analyzed to explain how these techniques impact GP
                   performance. The experimental results showed that the
                   investigated functional techniques have made GP more
                   powerful in the following ways: 1) polymorphism has
                   enabled GP to solve problems that are very difficult
                   for standard GP to solve, i.e. nth and map programs; 2)
                   higher-order functions and implicit recursion have
                   enhanced GP's ability in solving the general
                   even-parity problem to a greater degree than with any
                   other known methods. Moreover, the analysis showed that
                   these techniques directed GP to generate program
                   solutions in a way that has never been previously
                   reported. Finally, we provide the guidelines for the
                   application of these techniques to other problems.},
